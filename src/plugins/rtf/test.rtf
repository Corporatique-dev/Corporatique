Non disintegration}\: \par 
\pard \s18 {\fs18 Example\:  The basic principle of the computer desktop is that everything is on the two
-dimensional computer screen.  In the input space of real office work, the trashcan is not on the desktop.  By Topology, the location of the trashcan as not on the desktop would be projected to the computer interface blend; but doing so would destroy the i
nternal integration of the blend, which is why, on the computer screen desktop, the trashcan is on the desktop.  Integration of the blend in this case can only be achieved by relaxing the topology constraint. \par 
}\pard \s18 {\ul \par 
Non displacement}\:\par 
\pard \s18 {\fs18 Example\:  If a user is runn
ing five different applications on the desktop and wants to see only one of them, he can click "Hide Others" (conversely, "Show others"); to see a given document partially occluded by another, he need only click anywhere on the desired document.  But in th
e space of offices, to hide everything on your desk except the one thing you wish to focus on would require complex physical operations.  If these operations were all projected to the blend, it would sever its useful web connections to the input of compute
r operation.  Function guides competition here. }\par 
\pard \s18\sl280 {\ul \par 
Non interference}\:\par 
\pard \s18 {\fs18 Example\:
  In the space of office work, we often write "discard" across the top of an outdated version to be discarded.  In the computer desktop, the icon for a file has only one place for a label.  If we projected to the computer desktop the operation of l
abeling the document "discard" by making a click-command that put that label on the icon, we would lose the title of the file.  So the "title" label and the "discard" label from the space 
of office work defeat each other if both are projected to the blend.\par 
}\pard \s18 {\ul \par 
Non ambiguity}\:\par 
\pard \s18 {\fs18 Example\:
  Ejecting floppy disks.  Superposition of  icon a over icon b "means" copying/inserting the contents of a "into" b.  So a plausible interpretation of the disk icon being moved over the trashcan icon is that the contents of the disk is transferred 
to the trashcan.  But in fact, the meaning in this particular case is entirely different ("eject disk from computer").  This makes the superposition schema in the blend ambiguous.\par 
}\pard \s18\sl280 {\ul \par 
Backward projection}\:\par 
\pard \s18 {\fs18 Example\:  Under pressure from Integration, the desktop blend places the trashcan on the desktop, but projecting this relation backward to the input of the actual desks would disrupt their efficient use. \par 
}\pard \s18\sl280 {\ul \par 
Multiple violation}\:  \par 
{\fs18 Ejecting floppies.\par 
}\pard \s18 {\fs18 Copy/Paste\:  The command sequence Select-Copy-Paste on word-processing applications violates Topology.  In the Input where text is actually copied by scribes or xerox machines, copying (after selection) is a one-step operation.  There 
is no pasting and no clipboard.  Properties specific to the Integration in the blend make it convenient to decompose this operation into two, but they do not map topologically onto corresponding operations in the Input of "real copying."  The labels "Copy"
 and "Paste" chosen for these two operations in the Blend violate Web, and its corollary, Non-displacement\:
  the Copy operation in the Blend (which actually produces no visible change in the text) does not correspond to the Copy operation in the Input (whi
ch does produce visible change); the Paste operation, which does produce change, is closer to "copying" in the Input, but the label "Paste" suggests a counterpart (pasting), which is not even part of the copying process.\par
